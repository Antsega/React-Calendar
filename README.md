<ins>Purpose</ins>: 
<br> 
This project is a simple and fast application that allows a user to seemlessly log in using their google account and create an event that sync's with their pre-exsisting account. End goal is to combine this with my To-Do project; that way a user / myself can have a fast responding application that syncs with their phone.
